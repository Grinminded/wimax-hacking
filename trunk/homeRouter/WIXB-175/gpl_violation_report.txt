How license was violated:

		The notice is included in the compiled binaries, as well as in some configuration file on the device
	Is the source code completely missing?
		Yes, it is completely missing.
	Is there a written offer for source that's incomplete in some way? This could happen if it provides a contact address or network URL that's somehow incorrect.
		There is no written offer for source.
	Is there a copy of the license included in the distribution?
		There does not seem to be a copy of the license on the device, and there is not one included in the documentation
	Is some of the source available, but not all? If so, what parts are missing?
		No, none of the source is included.

Additional information:
I have politely requested a copy of source code, with no response after a two week wait.
My personal backup of the flash memory dump form my device: http://code.google.com/p/wimax-hacking/source/browse/trunk/homeRouter/WIXB-175/mtd_dump/
I can provide contents of specific files on request (such as, perhaps, the actual busybox binary on the device).

Usage: busybox [function] [arguments]...
   or: [function] [arguments]...

        BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix
        utilities into a single executable.  Most people will create a
        link to busybox for each function they wish to use and BusyBox
        will act like whatever it was invoked as!

Usage: mtd [<options> ...] <command> [<arguments> ...] <device>

The device is in the format of mtdX (eg: mtd4) or its label.
mtd recognizes these commands:
        unlock                  unlock the device
        erase                   erase all data on device
        write <imagefile>|-     write <imagefile> (use - for stdin) to device
Following options are available:
        -q                      quiet mode (once: no [w] on writing,
                                           twice: no status messages)
        -r                      reboot after successful command
        -f                      force write without trx checks
        -e <device>             erase <device> before executing the command

Example: To write linux.trx to mtd4 labeled as linux and reboot afterwards
         mtd -r write linux.trx linux
