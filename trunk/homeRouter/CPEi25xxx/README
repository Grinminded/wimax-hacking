Before you run unlock.sh, you should know that it will brik your device
unless you are very, very lucky.  You may exchange some preparation
time for luck by verifying that you have the following:

- OpenOCD version 0.5.0-dev-00183-gdecad30 (2010-04-14-17:41)
- screen
- nc.traditional
- read/write access to your serial device (default /dev/ttyUSB0)
- read/write access to your parallel device (/dev/lp0 for JTAG, or
	configure openocd to use something else)

Once you have that all installed, do some testing.  To test openocd,
run it from this directory without arguments like so:

    $ openocd

And that will start up the daemon which provides output like the
following if your device is connected and all is well:

    Open On-Chip Debugger 0.5.0-dev-00183-gdecad30 (2010-04-14-17:41)

    parport port = 0x0
    srst_only separate srst_gates_jtag srst_push_pull
    Info : clock speed 500 kHz
    Info : JTAG tap: tnetv1061.cpu tap/device found: 0x1b6c602f (mfg: 0x017, part: 0xb6c6, ver: 0x1)

Now you can connect to the daemon via telnet like this:

    $ telnet localhost 4444
    Open On-Chip Debugger
    >

And then do stuff like reset, initialize, and peek at a few addresses:

    > reset init
    JTAG tap: tnetv1061.cpu tap/device found: 0x1b6c602f (mfg: 0x017, part: 0xb6c6, ver: 0x1)

Once you really think you are ready you can get on with the bricking:
    $ ./unlock [serial device]
